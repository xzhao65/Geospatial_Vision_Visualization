Final_Project_Script.ipynb
	Source code of point cloud processing
	Including:
		1.DBSCAN method based on Planarity Measure calculation to detect Road
		2.RANSAC method to detect Road and lane markings on Road  
		3.Visualization of point cloud based on PPTK 
final_project_output.csv
	Labeled tag of data of point cloud
	Data format:
		[X] [Y] [altitude] [point_tag]
		point_tag indicates the relationship between point and lane marking.

	Description of algorithm of auto-detecting lane marking.

IMAGE_OUTPUT folder
Including images from fixed angle of observation:
	

	1.Raw point cloud data which are colored based on intenstiy

	2.Plane points which are colored by different plane labels

	3.Actual lane marking points which are colored by different lane marking labels

	4.Virtual lane marking lines(include Actual lane marking and its extension line)
	
	5.Enhanced lane marking lines(generated by fitting model to improve the quality of 	  visualization)

	6.Result of first method which is based on Planarity Measure.
	
	7.Plane points which are filtered by intenstiy over than 20.

	8.Satistical Report about the distribution of point tag(generated by our model)
